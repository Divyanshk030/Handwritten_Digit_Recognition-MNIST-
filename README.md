Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
A beginner-friendly project that teaches a computer to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using artificial intelligence. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the MNIST dataset. It’s useful for smart exam grading and educational technology.

Main Features and Objectives
Recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from images.

Uses a CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras.

Trains and tests on the MNIST dataset.

Achieves over 98% accuracy on digit recognition.

Can be extended with a simple user interface to draw and predict digits.

How to Install and Run the Project
Install Python (from python.org) if you don’t have it.

Install required packages by running:

text
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Download or copy the project code to your computer. Save it as mnist_digit_recognition.py.

Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:

text
python mnist_digit_recognition.py
Requirements
Python 3.x

TensorFlow

NumPy

matplotlib (optional, for plotting images)

Example Usage / Output
When you run the script, you will see output like:

text
Epoch 1/5
...
Epoch 5/5
...
Test accuracy: 98.50%
This means the program can recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy.
